this repo is a sandbox for us to build a dash visualization app based on Simplecast response data

Eventually want this to replace our Power BI dashboard as a visualization tool

[Plotly Dash docs](https://dash.plotly.com)

Info on plotly callbacks (used in our downloads_total app) can be found ![here](https://dash.plotly.com/basic-callbacks).

To use the podcasts-downloads dashboard, run `python app.py` from the command line and visit the HTTP port from the local server
